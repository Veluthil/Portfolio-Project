            <br>
            <h2>Soft Skills and Background.</h2>
            <p>Directly by higher education, I am a veterinarian. Obtaining Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree proved
                that I am a highly analytical, dependable person with compassion and problem-solving skills, who wants
                to constantly improve no matter the obstacles.
                It also taught me how to think critically and holistically, work with great perseverance, think outside
                the box, learn fast and easily adjust to new environments.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies and Trivia.</h2>
            <p>Since my early childhood I have been and continue to be fascinated by Japan and its culture.
                In my spare time I am aiming to master Japanese language and eventually try working in Tokyo or Osaka.
                Some time ago I've discovered programming and instantly fallen in love with it. My other hobbies
                include:
                cybersecurity, painting, playing video games, reading, watching movies and anime, medicine,
                universe and basic quantum physics, strength training, gothic style and Victorian era.
            </p>
            <p>As an INTJ I always dream big and do everything to achieve my goals. Having this personality
                type helps me with mixing both analytical and ambitious part of me with creative and dreamy one.
