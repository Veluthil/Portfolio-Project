            <h2 id="whoami">Who am I.</h2>
            <p>I'm a Backend Developer committed to mastering the nuances of Python, embracing best practices, and
                engineering robust server-side solutions. My knowledge extends to esteemed frameworks like Django and
                Flask, empowering me to design dynamic web applications and resilient APIs.</p>
            <p>Yet, my aspirations extend beyond the realm of backend development. Driven by an insatiable curiosity,
                I find myself drawn to the realms of DevOps and cybersecurity. These domains offer a harmonious convergence
                of my Python prowess with a broader understanding of safeguarding and deploying applications.</p>
            <p>DevOps, with its orchestration of automation, continuous integration, and deployment, deeply resonates
                with me. It embodies an opportunity to streamline the software development lifecycle, nurturing seamless
                collaboration between development and operations. Gaining a panoramic view of development from the
                Linux console invigorates me, and I eagerly anticipate optimizing software delivery to elevate both
                reliability and efficiency, ultimately fostering unparalleled user experiences.</p>
            <p>The realm of cybersecurity, an ever-evolving tapestry of challenges, captivates my intellect. As I expand
                my horizons, I'm dedicated to interweaving cybersecurity best practices into my development methodology,
                fortifying the digital creations I engineer against potential vulnerabilities. The intricacies of both
                red teaming and blue teaming captivate me in equal measure, propelling me to a simultaneous journey of
                growth and learning across both spectrums.</p>
            <p>Amidst my technical aptitude, there exists an artistic finesse that fuels my passion for crafting not
                only functional, but aesthetically pleasing websites. While my primary focus remains entrenched in
                backend development, I am acutely aware of the symbiotic relationship between backend and frontend
                intricacies. I hold in high regard the imperative of delivering superlative user experiences through
                meticulously designed interfaces.</p>
            <p>The hallmark of my professional odyssey is an unwavering commitment to perpetual learning. I ardently
                pledge to remain abreast of the latest advancements in Python, the evolving landscape of backend
                development practices, and the enticing possibilities that beckon in the realms of DevOps and
                cybersecurity. Through this tireless dedication, I stand poised to contribute significantly to the
                vanguard of avant-garde, fortified, and user-centric applications.</p>

            <p>While my higher education is in veterinary medicine, I have developed a broad range of skills that
                are transferable to other fields. As a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM), I have demonstrated that I
                am an analytical and reliable individual with a compassionate nature and a strong problem-solving
                mindset. My education has taught me to approach problems critically and holistically, and to work
                with great perseverance and resilience in the face of obstacles. Additionally, I have developed
                a capacity for thinking outside the box, learning quickly, and adapting easily to new environments.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies and Trivia.</h2>
            <p>I have always been fascinated by Japanese culture since childhood, and this interest continues to
                this day. In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in the language and aim to become fluent,
                with the ultimate goal of working in Tokyo or Osaka. Additionally, I discovered programming over
                a year ago and fell in love with it instantly. Beyond that, I have a diverse range of hobbies,
                including cybersecurity, painting, playing video games, reading, watching movies and anime,
                studying medicine, exploring the universe, learning about simple quantum physics,
                engaging in strength training, running, and admiring gothic style and the Victorian era.
            </p>
            <p>As an INTJ personality type, I am ambitious and analytical, always striving to achieve my goals.
                My creative and dreamy side is just as important, and I find that this balance of traits
                serves me well in pursuing my passions.
