            <h2 id="whoami">Who am I.</h2>
            <p>I'm a <b>Python Developer</b> with a focus on backend development.
                With a passion for backend development, I strive to master the intricacies of Python and explore
                the best practices in building high-performance and reliable server-side solutions. I enjoy working
                with frameworks such as <b>Django</b> and <b>Flask</b>, using their capabilities to develop robust APIs
                and web applications.</p>
            <p>While my main area of expertise is Python backend development, I also have a keen interest in exploring
                the realms of <b>DevOps</b> and <b>cybersecurity</b>. These potential roles intrigue me as they allow me
                to combine my Python skills with broader knowledge in securing and deploying applications.</p>
            <p><b>DevOps</b>, with its focus on automation, continuous integration, and deployment, appeals to me as it offers
                an opportunity to streamline the software development lifecycle and optimize collaboration between
                development and operations teams. I see DevOps as a means to enhance the reliability and efficiency of
                software delivery, ultimately resulting in better products and user experiences. Plus, I really enjoy
                living in the Linux's console and seeing the bigger picture of development.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, <b>cybersecurity</b> is an ever-evolving field that captures my curiosity. As I continue to grow
                my knowledge, I aspire to incorporate cybersecurity best practices into my development process, ensuring
                that the applications I build are resilient against potential threats. I find red team and
                blue team equally appealing, so I continue to learn them simultaneously for now.</p>
            <p>I am also an <b>artistic</b> and creative individual, and I find joy in creating aesthetically pleasing and
                functional websites. While backend development is my primary focus, I appreciate the synergy between
                backend and <b>frontend development</b>, and I value the importance of delivering exceptional user experiences
                through well-designed interfaces.</p>
            <p><b>Continuous learning is at the core of my professional journey</b>. I'm committed to staying up-to-date with
                the latest advancements in Python, backend development practices, and exploring potential roles in
                DevOps and cybersecurity. By expanding my knowledge and honing my skills, I aim to contribute to the
                development of cutting-edge, secure, and user-friendly applications.</p>

            <p>While my higher education is in veterinary medicine, I have developed a broad range of skills that
                are transferable to other fields. As a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM), I have demonstrated that I
                am an analytical and reliable individual with a compassionate nature and a strong problem-solving
                mindset. My education has taught me to approach problems critically and holistically, and to work
                with great perseverance and resilience in the face of obstacles. Additionally, I have developed
                a capacity for thinking outside the box, learning quickly, and adapting easily to new environments.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies and Trivia.</h2>
            <p>I have always been fascinated by Japanese culture since childhood, and this interest continues to
                this day. In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in the language and aim to become fluent,
                with the ultimate goal of working in Tokyo or Osaka. Additionally, I discovered programming over
                a year ago and fell in love with it instantly. Beyond that, I have a diverse range of hobbies,
                including cybersecurity, painting, playing video games, reading, watching movies and anime,
                studying medicine, exploring the universe, learning about simple quantum physics,
                engaging in strength training, running, and admiring gothic style and the Victorian era.
            </p>
            <p>As an INTJ personality type, I am ambitious and analytical, always striving to achieve my goals.
                My creative and dreamy side is just as important, and I find that this balance of traits
                serves me well in pursuing my passions.
