            <h2 class="subtitle">I am a hard-working junior Python programmer who has fallen in love with coding and
                want to share
                my new fascination and skills with others.</h2>
            <br>
            <h2>What I can do.</h2>
            <p>My main interest lies in Python and backend development, however I am also determined in broadening my
                front-end skills in order to achieve a full-stack developer title in the upcoming future.
                I enjoy working with Flask framework and creating aesthetically designed websites to please not only
                myself, but also anyone, who would like to work with me.
                My other IT interest lies in cybersecurity, therefore I am always aware of applying secure solutions and
                features into my pieces of work.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Soft Skills.</h2>
            <p>Strictly by higher education, I am a veterinarian. Obtaining Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree proved
                that I am a highly analytical, dependable person with compassion and problem-solving skills, who wants
                to constantly improve no matter the obstacles.
                It also taught me how to think critically and holistically, work with great perseverance, think outside
                the box, learn fast and easily adjust to new environments.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Hobbies and trivia.</h2>
            <p>Since my early childhood I have been and continue to be fascinated by Japan and its culture.
                In my spare time I am aiming to master Japanese language and eventually try working in Tokyo or Osaka.
                Some time ago I've discovered programming and instantly fallen in love with it. My other hobbies include:
                cybersecurity, painting, playing video games, reading, watching movies and anime, medicine,
                universe and basic quantum physics, strength training, gothic style and Victorian era.
            </p>
            <p>As an INTJ I always dream big and do everything to achieve my goals. Having this personality
                type helps me with mixing both analytical and ambitious part of me with creative and dreamy one.
