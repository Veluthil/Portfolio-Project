            <h2 class="subtitle">As a dedicated Python programmer, I have developed a deep passion for coding
                and am eager to share my newfound skills and enthusiasm with others.</h2>
            <br>
            <h2>What I can do.</h2>
            <p>I specialize in Python and back-end development, but I'm enthusiastic about expanding my skill set to
                include front-end development. One aspect that truly excites me is creating visually appealing and
                highly functional applications, which fuels my motivation to delve deeper into front-end development.
                Additionally, my strong passion for cybersecurity drives me to prioritize secure solutions and features
                in all of my work. This is one of the reasons why I'm particularly drawn to the field of Dev(Sec)Ops.</p>
            <p>I firmly believe in adopting a holistic approach to problem-solving as it consistently leads to more
                effective solutions. When working on projects, I often rely on the Django framework to ensure that the
                end result is not only visually pleasing but also fully functional and secure.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Technical Skills.</h2>
            <p>Python, Django, Flask, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, PyTest, Git, GitHub, SQLite, Postgres.</p>
            <p>Currently learning: Docker, AWS, Linux, JavaScript.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Languages.</h2>

            <br>
            <h2>Soft Skills and Background.</h2>
            <p>While my higher education is in veterinary medicine, I have developed a broad range of skills that
                are transferable to other fields. As a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, I have demonstrated that I am a
                highly analytical and reliable individual with a compassionate nature and a strong problem-solving
                mindset. My education has taught me to approach problems critically and holistically, and to work
                with great perseverance and resilience in the face of obstacles. Additionally, I have developed
                a capacity for thinking outside the box, learning quickly, and adapting easily to new environments.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Hobbies and Trivia.</h2>
            <p>I have always been fascinated by Japanese culture since childhood, and this interest continues to
                this day. In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in the language and aim to become fluent,
                with the ultimate goal of working in Tokyo or Osaka. Additionally, I discovered programming over
                a year ago and fell in love with it instantly. Beyond that, I have a diverse range of hobbies,
                including cybersecurity, painting, playing video games, reading, watching movies and anime,
                studying medicine, exploring the universe, learning about simple quantum physics,
                engaging in strength training, running, and admiring gothic style and the Victorian era.
            </p>
            <p>As an INTJ personality type, I am ambitious and analytical, always striving to achieve my goals.
                My creative and dreamy side is just as important, and I find that this balance of traits
                serves me well in pursuing my passions.
