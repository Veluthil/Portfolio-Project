            <h2 class="subtitle">As a dedicated Python programmer, I have developed a deep passion for coding
                and am eager to share my newfound skills and enthusiasm with others.</h2>
            <br>
            <h2>Who am I.</h2>
            <p>I'm a Python developer with a strong focus on backend development. My expertise lies in leveraging
                Python's power and versatility to create efficient, scalable, and robust applications.
                With a passion for backend development, I strive to master the intricacies of Python and explore
                the best practices in building high-performance and reliable server-side solutions. I enjoy working
                with frameworks such as Django and Flask, using their capabilities to develop robust APIs
                and web applications.</p>
                <p>While my main area of expertise is Python backend development, I also have a keen interest in exploring
                the realms of DevOps and cybersecurity. These potential roles intrigue me as they allow me to combine
                my Python skills with broader knowledge in securing and deploying applications.</p>
                <p>DevOps, with its focus on automation, continuous integration, and deployment, appeals to me as it offers
                an opportunity to streamline the software development lifecycle and optimize collaboration between
                development and operations teams. I see DevOps as a means to enhance the reliability and efficiency of
                software delivery, ultimately resulting in better products and user experiences.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, cybersecurity is an ever-evolving field that captures my curiosity. As I continue to grow
                my knowledge, I aspire to incorporate cybersecurity best practices into my development process, ensuring
                that the applications I build are robust and resilient against potential threats.</p>
                <p>I am also an artistic and creative individual, and I find joy in creating aesthetically pleasing and
                functional websites. While backend development is my primary focus, I appreciate the synergy between
                backend and frontend development, and I value the importance of delivering exceptional user experiences
                through well-designed interfaces.</p>
                <p>Continuous learning is at the core of my professional journey. I'm committed to staying up-to-date with
                the latest advancements in Python, backend development practices, and exploring potential roles in
                DevOps and cybersecurity. By expanding my knowledge and honing my skills, I aim to contribute to the
                development of cutting-edge, secure, and user-friendly applications.</p>
