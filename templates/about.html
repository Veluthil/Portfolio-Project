            <h2 id="whoami">Who am I.</h2>
            <p>As a dedicated Python Developer, my heart lies in the realm of backend development. I have set my sights
                on mastering the intricacies of Python, delving into best practices, and crafting high-performance,
                reliable server-side solutions. My proficiency extends to frameworks like Django and Flask, empowering
                me to build robust APIs and dynamic web applications.</p>
            <p>Yet, my journey doesn't stop at backend expertise. My thirst for knowledge propels me towards exploring
                the captivating worlds of DevOps and cybersecurity. These domains provide the perfect union of my Python
                skills with broader knowledge in securing and deploying applications.</p>
            <p>DevOps, with its emphasis on automation, continuous integration, and deployment, deeply resonates with
                me. I view it as a transformative opportunity to streamline the software development lifecycle,
                fostering seamless collaboration between development and operations teams. Witnessing the bigger picture
                of development from the Linux console invigorates me, and I eagerly anticipate optimizing software
                delivery to enhance reliability and efficiency for exceptional user experiences.</p>
            <p>Cybersecurity, an ever-evolving realm, enthralls me with its dynamic challenges. As I expand my
                expertise, I strive to weave cybersecurity best practices into my development process, fortifying the
                applications I create against potential threats. Both red teaming and blue teaming intrigue me equally,
                prompting me to learn and grow in both domains simultaneously.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical prowess, I possess an artistic flair that fuels my passion for creating
                aesthetically pleasing and functional websites. While backend development remains my primary focus,
                I recognize the symbiotic relationship between backend and frontend development. I value the
                significance of delivering exceptional user experiences through well-designed interfaces.</p>
            <p>My professional journey revolves around continuous learning as its core tenet. I remain committed to
                keeping abreast of the latest advancements in Python, backend development practices, and the pursuit of
                potential roles in DevOps and cybersecurity. Through this relentless dedication, I am poised to
                contribute to the development of cutting-edge, secure, and user-friendly applications.</p>

            <p>While my higher education is in veterinary medicine, I have developed a broad range of skills that
                are transferable to other fields. As a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM), I have demonstrated that I
                am an analytical and reliable individual with a compassionate nature and a strong problem-solving
                mindset. My education has taught me to approach problems critically and holistically, and to work
                with great perseverance and resilience in the face of obstacles. Additionally, I have developed
                a capacity for thinking outside the box, learning quickly, and adapting easily to new environments.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies and Trivia.</h2>
            <p>I have always been fascinated by Japanese culture since childhood, and this interest continues to
                this day. In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in the language and aim to become fluent,
                with the ultimate goal of working in Tokyo or Osaka. Additionally, I discovered programming over
                a year ago and fell in love with it instantly. Beyond that, I have a diverse range of hobbies,
                including cybersecurity, painting, playing video games, reading, watching movies and anime,
                studying medicine, exploring the universe, learning about simple quantum physics,
                engaging in strength training, running, and admiring gothic style and the Victorian era.
            </p>
            <p>As an INTJ personality type, I am ambitious and analytical, always striving to achieve my goals.
                My creative and dreamy side is just as important, and I find that this balance of traits
                serves me well in pursuing my passions.
