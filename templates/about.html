            <h2 class="subtitle">As a dedicated Python programmer, I have developed a deep passion for coding
                and am eager to share my newfound skills and enthusiasm with others.</h2>
            <br>
            <h2>What I can do.</h2>
            <p>While my primary area of expertise is in Python and back-end development, I am keen to expand my skills
                into the front-end space as well. I take great pleasure in designing visually appealing websites,
                which is why I am motivated to learn more about front-end development. Additionally, I am deeply
                interested in AI and DevOps, as I find these topics incredibly compelling. I believe that approaching
                problems from a holistic perspective can lead to more effective solutions. In my projects, I often use
                Django framework to ensure that the end result is not only visually pleasing but also functional.
                Furthermore, I have a strong passion for cybersecurity, which drives me to implement secure solutions
                and features in all of my work. As a result, I am particularly interested in the field of Dev(Sec)Ops.</p>

            <h2>Soft Skills and Background.</h2>
            <p>While my higher education is in veterinary medicine, I have developed a broad range of skills that
                are transferable to other fields. As a MSc Veterinary, I have demonstrated that I am a highly analytical
                and reliable individual with a compassionate nature and a strong problem-solving mindset. My education
                has taught me to approach problems critically and holistically, and to work with great perseverance and
                resilience in the face of obstacles. Additionally, I have developed a capacity for thinking outside
                the box, learning quickly, and adapting easily to new environments.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Hobbies and Trivia.</h2>
            <p>I have always been fascinated by Japanese culture since childhood, and this interest continues to
                this day. In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in the language and aim to become fluent,
                with the ultimate goal of working in Tokyo or Osaka. Additionally, I discovered programming over
                a year ago and fell in love with it instantly. Beyond that, I have a diverse range of hobbies,
                including cybersecurity, painting, playing video games, reading, watching movies and anime,
                studying medicine, exploring the universe, learning about simple quantum physics,
                engaging in strength training, running, and admiring gothic style and the Victorian era.
            </p>
            <p>As an INTJ personality type, I am ambitious and analytical, always striving to achieve my goals.
                My creative and dreamy side is just as important, and I find that this balance of traits
                serves me well in pursuing my passions.
