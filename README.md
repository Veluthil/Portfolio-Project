# Portfolio-Project

Portfolio-Project is a website created with Flask framework, Bootstrap 5, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. 

Its purpose is to act as a source of information about me and my programming work and also to allow anyone to check 
out my other websites and programs through attached hyperlinks redirecting to them.

This project contains an email form, which allows sending me a message via SMTP - having in mind cybersecurity, 
I implemented here an HTML sanitizer that parses each client's input by an algorithm that sanitizes tags, attributes,
unescaped characters, unclosed, and misnested tags.

I deployed this project on render.com: 
https://mboradyn.onrender.com

I plan to develop this website further.
