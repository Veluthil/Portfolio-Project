# Portfolio-Project

Portfolio-Project is a website created with Flask framework, Bootstrap 5, CSS, HTML and JavaScript. 

Its main purpose is to act as a source of information about me and my programming work, also to allow to check out my other websites and programmes
through attached hyperlinks redirecting to them.

This project contains an email form, which allows to send me a message via SMTP - having in mind cybersecurity, 
I implemented here an HTML sanitizer that parses each client's input by an algorithm which sanitizes tags, attributes,
unescaped characters, unclosed and misnested tags.

I deployed this project on render.com, here is the URL: 
https://mboradyn.onrender.com

I plan to develop this website further.
